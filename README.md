This command line program schedules commands for execution in an interactive shell with cron expressions. It will keep
executing the provided command until interrupted or until specified conditions are met.

As simple as

`cronthat "* * * * * *" -- echo are we there yet "?"`
> Prints "are we there yet ?" every second.

`cronthat "0 */5 12 * * *" --until "2030-01-13 00:00:00" -- count-sheep`
> Count sheep every five minutes between 12:00 PM and 12:59 PM and stop in 2030 (you can still `CTRL-C` if you find sleep).

`cronthat "0 0 2 * * *" --now -- ./scripts/etl.sh`
> Execute an ETL script every day at 2 PM and force a first execution now.

There are a few other tricks but `cronthat` is really not that complicated and the `--help` flag should be enough.

# Installation

## From source

`cronthat` is written in rust, so you can just run `cargo install --git https://github.com/yannduperis/cronthat.git cronthat` 
while I manage to get releases and packages (crates.io, AUR and Brew).

# Why ?

I needed a command to be reliably executed every day (while away from my computer). For such a single-use case, I didn't 
want the hassle of a cron task, but I wanted that sweet syntax for scheduled execution. Believe it or not, I couldn't
find a simple tool to start "single-use" cron tasks that I can see live in my terminal and terminate with 
`CTRL-C. Now there is one.
